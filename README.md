# Natural language processing problem in IITG data science hackathon.
Given a labelled dataset (train.csv) containing several different material types (such as books, videodisc, sounddisc etc) with a description of them which involved their title, name of writer, publication information and summary.
We were asked to predict the material type of the contents of test.csv and write them to another csv file.
An accuracy of over 86% was acheived.
