# Natural language processing problem in IITG data science hackathon.
Given a labelled dataset (train.csv) having the title, subjects and other features based on which we have to predict what will be the ideal material type  (such as books, videodisc, sounddisc etc) of that to-be-published research so that one can tie-up with an ideal publisher and help them grow.
We were asked to predict the material type of the contents of test.csv and write them to another csv file.
An accuracy of over 86% was acheived.
